Roadmap

The AOP of Dexposed is such a powerful tool for Android app development, but current now it also has some defect. So we lead this roadmap.
We have a list of features that we plan to implement. The Roadmap aims to set out when certain features will appear. It reduces in clarity the further we go into the future, and is constantly being added to as we move forward. It's just a list, but we're adding more detail to it as we go.
